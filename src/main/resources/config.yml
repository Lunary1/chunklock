# This is the main configuration file for the Chunklock plugin.

#   - economy.yml          → Economy and payment settings
#   - openai.yml           → OpenAI integration settings
#   - block-values.yml     → Block values and biome weights for chunk scoring

#   - debug.yml            → Debug and logging options
#   - performance.yml      → Performance tuning settings
#
# All these files are automatically loaded from the plugin's data folder.
