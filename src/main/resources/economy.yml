# Economy type: "materials" or "vault"
# "materials" = Players pay with items/resources (default behavior)
# "vault" = Players pay with money through Vault economy plugin
type: "materials"

# Vault economy settings (only used if type = "vault")
vault:
  # Base cost multiplier for vault payments
  base-cost: 100.0
  # Additional cost per unlocked chunk (progressive pricing)
  cost-per-unlocked: 25.0
  # Difficulty multipliers
  difficulty-multipliers:
    EASY: 0.5
    NORMAL: 1.0
    HARD: 2.0
    IMPOSSIBLE: 4.0
  # Biome-specific cost multipliers

    # Add more biomes as needed

# Material economy settings (only used if type = "materials")
materials:
  # Enable/disable material requirements
  enabled: true
  # Allow fallback to vault if materials not available
  vault-fallback: false

  # Cost calculation mode for materials:
  #   "biome"         - (Default) Requires specific materials based on biome type (e.g., Plains -> WHEAT)
  #   "resource-scan" - Scans player's owned chunks and requires materials that are actually available
  #                     Solves the issue where players spawn in chunks without the biome's required materials
  cost-mode: "biome"

  # Resource-scan settings (only used if cost-mode = "resource-scan")
  resource-scan:
    # Base cost in items (before tier/progression multipliers)
    base-cost: 16
    # Maximum items required for a single unlock
    max-cost: 128
    # Minimum items required for a single unlock
    min-cost: 1
    # Minimum block count in owned chunks to consider a material available
    min-abundance: 10
    # How long to cache scan results per player (in seconds)
    cache-duration: 60

# Material-to-vault conversion values (used when AI converts material costs to vault)
# Values represent vault cost per unit of material
