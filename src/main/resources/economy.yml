#          CHUNKLOCK ECONOMY CONFIG
# =============================================
#
# How do players pay to unlock chunks?
#
#   "materials"  →  Players pay with items from their inventory (default)
#                   Configure what items in biome-unlocks.yml
#
#   "vault"      →  Players pay with money (requires Vault plugin)
#
type: "materials"

#  MATERIAL ECONOMY  (type: "materials")
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────
materials:
  enabled: true

  # How costs are determined:
  #
  #   "biome"          →  Each biome has fixed material costs (see biome-unlocks.yml)
  #                       Example: Plains always costs Wheat, Forest costs Oak Logs
  #                       Simple and predictable, but players can get stuck if their
  #                       starting chunk doesn't contain the required material.
  #
  #   "resource-scan"  →  Scans blocks in the player's owned chunks and picks a
  #                       material they can actually gather. Costs scale with rarity.
  #                       Example: a player on a plains chunk with no trees pays
  #                       Cobblestone or Wheat instead of Oak Logs.
  #                       Prevents early-game soft-locks.
  #
  cost-mode: "resource-scan"

  # Resource-scan tuning (only when cost-mode: "resource-scan")
  resource-scan:
    base-cost: 16 # Starting item amount (adjusted by material rarity & progression)
    min-cost: 1 # Floor — never ask for fewer than this
    max-cost: 128 # Cap — never ask for more than this
    min-abundance: 10 # Ignore materials with fewer than this many blocks in owned chunks
    cache-duration: 60 # Seconds to cache scan results per player (avoids lag)

  # If true, fall back to Vault money when the player can't pay with materials.
  # Requires Vault to be installed.
  vault-fallback: false

# ─────────────────────────────────────────────
#  VAULT / MONEY ECONOMY  (type: "vault")
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────
vault:
  base-cost: 100.0 # Base price per chunk
  cost-per-unlocked: 25.0 # Added per chunk the player already owns (progressive pricing)
  #                          Example: 3rd chunk = 100 + (2 × 25) = $150

  # Multiply the final price by chunk difficulty
  difficulty-multipliers:
    EASY: 0.5
    NORMAL: 1.0
    HARD: 2.0
    IMPOSSIBLE: 4.0

  # Multiply the final price by biome (unlisted biomes default to 1.0)
  biome-multipliers:

#  AI COST CONVERSION  (advanced, optional)
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────
# When the OpenAI agent converts material costs to Vault prices,
# these values set the exchange rate per item.
# Only used when both AI costing and Vault are active.
