# chunklock
Chunklock is a Minecraft plugin that restricts players to specific chunks until they unlock them. Chunks can be unlocked by providing biome specific items. The plugin also tracks how many chunks each player has unlocked.

## Commands

- `/chunklock status` – show how many chunks you have unlocked.
- `/chunklock unlock` – open a GUI to attempt unlocking your current chunk. The same interface appears automatically when you try to enter a locked chunk.
- `/chunklock bypass [player]` – admin: toggle bypass mode for a player.
- `/chunklock reset <player>` – admin: reset a player's progress.
